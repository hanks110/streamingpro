## What's StreamingPro and MLSQL?

StreamingPro is mainly designed to run on Apache Spark but it also supports Apache Flink for the runtime.
Thus, it can be considered as a cross,distributed platform which is the combination of BigData platform and AI platform
where you can run  both Big Data Processing and Machine Learning script.


MLSQL is a DSL akin to SQL but more powerfull based on StreamingPro platform. Since StreamingPro have already
intergrated many ML frameworks including Spark MLLib, DL4J and Python ML framework eg. Sklearn, Tensorflow(supporting cluster mode)
this means you can use MLSQL to operate all these popular Machine Learning frameworks.

## Why MLSQL

MLSQL give you the power to use just one SQL-like language to finish all your Machine Learning  pipeline.  It also provides so
many modules and functions to help you simplify the complexity of building Machine Learning application.

1. MLSQL is the only one language you should take over.
2. Data preproccessing created in training phase can also be used in streaming, batch , API service directly without coding.
3. Server mode make you get rid of environment trouble.
